# AutoShopGen
Don't mind why generateShopJson is written HORRIBLY
## how to run

1.) install nodejs

2.) run `npm i`

3.) run either `node generateDaily` or `node generateFeatured`

## problems

I'm not fixing problems myself, just rerun the file if it errors.
If you want to fix my horrible code (or make it readable), go right ahead.

## info

generateFeatured just generates skins

if you want to generate other stuff for featured just copy generateDaily and add outfits to the array and change ` if (amountGrabbed < 6)` to ` if (amountGrabbed < 2)`
